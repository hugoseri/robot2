# Robot design project
This repository represents the work done for a school project on designing the software of a robot.   

# Robot features
Here are the different robot features :
* The robot is controlled with a smartphone using Bluetooth simplified with [Arduino Bluetooth RC Car](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller&gl=BE),
* The robot is able to move forward and backward at different speeds,
* The robot can park himself automaticaly at a saved position.

# About the code
The code is written in C using STM32CubeMX IDE.
